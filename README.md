# [Sketch Unifier](https://github.com/kahi/SketchUnifier), plugin for Sketch

Sets two selected layers to same size.

Makes replacing layers faster.

My workflow:
1. Select old layer (to be replaced)
2. Paste new layer (CMD-V)
3. Select the previous layer too (CMD-click)
4. Press **CTRL-Shift-I** to set them to identical X/Y
5. Press **CTRL-Shift-O** to set them to same size
